yolov8_n_bookspine.pt:
first attempt
batch=4, seemed like it was a little too close to maxing out the memory

yolov8_n_23aug2023.pt:
added data augmentation to hyperparamters in data.yaml, set all values to 0.5 probability
doesnt seem to have changed too much. I think not enough test samples

yolov8_n_24aug2023.pt:
data augmentation probabilities set to 1.0

yolov8_n_24aug2023_2.pt:
expanded training set

yolov8_n_24aug2023_3.pt:
expanded training set plus data augmentation (1.0s)
