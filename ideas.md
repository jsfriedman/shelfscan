entire idea:
* user opens app on phone
* live view of camera
* point at bookshelf
* visual indicator of which books the user might enjoy

potential starting point:
* single image as input
* identify all books spines in the image
* determine text on the bookspine
* resolve text to a Book
* see how that book scores on the users profile
* return set of recommended books
